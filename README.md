# ⚠️ Back up your `config` files

🚀 Install everything with a single command:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phucleeuwu/Dotflow/main/i.sh)
```

⇅ Upgrade everything with a single command `brew install topgrade`:

```bash
topgrade
```

## 📂 Breakdown of the `i.sh`

1. Installs Homebrew 🍺 (if not installed).
2. Clones the dotfiles repository into ~/dotfiles.
3. Removes existing `~/.zshrc` and `~/.config` to prevent conflicts.
4. Uses `Stow` to symlink `~/dotfiles` to `~/.config`.
6. Installs Homebrew 🍺 packages from Brewfile (optional).
